                My name is Zane Hutchison and I'm an 18-year-old from Australia and am currently studying a Bachelor of
                Computer Science. I’ve been investing my own money since February 2019 and have been trying to compound
                my knowledge along with my money ever since then. Net net investing appeals to me due to its clear-cut
                criteria, wide margins of safety and fantastic returns.
            </p>
            <p>
                The main issue with worthwhile net nets… actually finding them. On my net net journey, I found myself
                spending many hours grinding through a multitude of resources and collecting relevant data in search of
                50 cent dollars. However, due to my limited capital, the financial return on my time was undoubtedly
                getting short changed (a casual Macca’s job was looking tasty). So here we are.
            </p>
            <p>
                My experience with net net screening sites is unsatisfactory to say the least. The data is outdated, the
                options are limited, and a lot of the hidden gems are missing (well they are hidden I guess). For this
                reason, I decided that at a reasonable price I could leverage the data I have collected to provide a
                quality service for fellow net net investors.
